Acoustid Index
==============

Acoustid Index is a "number search engine". It's similar to text search
engines, but instead of searching in documents that consist of words,
it searches in documents that consist of 32-bit integers.

It's a simple inverted index data structure that doesn't do any kind of
processing on the indexed documents. This is useful for searching in
Chromaprint[1] audio fingerprints, which are nothing more than 32-bit
integer arrays.
